# hello-world

Hello!

I am a future web developer! I graduate next May! Yay! 
I can't describe the feelings I am dealing with as the months speed by.
Over the past few months, I have grown to love coding!  I truly love 
HTML and CSS!  I found that designing a web page is an amazing 
experience!  My first time working in WordPress was so much fun but
confusing at time! Haha!  I love the process of building a web site from scratch.
